# Offseason-2018

In the 2018 FRC Offseason, Cortechs started experimenting with the Python RobotPy library to control our robots. In this repository are a variety of projects familarizing students with this new language and exploring advanced topics. 

The Individual folder contains simple projects created by members on the team. The Examples folder contains code from past seasons or outside sources. We also experimented with characterizing our drive train (DT_Characterization folder), generating quintic spline paths (SimplePF folder) and implementing the Command Framework to handle complicated routines (Command folder). Finally we had projects to control an outreach robot (Outreach Code Final folder) and a simple Drive Train (Drive Train Project folder). 

Many of these projects were continued and used in the 2019 Build Season. Feel free to reach out with comments or suggestions!
